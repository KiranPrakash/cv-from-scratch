# cv-from-scratch

This repo contains implementation of popular computer vision/image analysis techniques from scratch in python without using any external libraries or modules.

# Who is this for?
This is meant for someone who is new to coding and computer vision engineering, who would like to understand how certain popular cv algorithms like finding key features, descriptors, clustering,segmentations, etc in a given image. 

# Why use this?
There are lot of computer vision frameworks like MATLAB, OpenCV, SciLab, etc that explains how to use the functions. But for someone who is a newbie to programming and computer vision, would find really hard to understand the highly optimized source code. Often you will wonder how the original author of a certain technique was implemented at the very first time. And there are tons of tutorials available that explains how to use them, but very little or there are hardly any open source code base that are available for first-time implementation

# How to use this?
All you need is a Python 2.7> and numpy. Just run the python script with proper input image files.

# What this is not?
This is nowhere close to an optimized solution. One should look for standard computer vision libraries if you would like to use it for your real projects.
